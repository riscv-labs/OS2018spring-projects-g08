## Ucore for risc-v 64bit

### Run:

**NOTICE**: If you want run ucore risc-v 64 in SMP, please checkout to smp branch. (master branch is not the newest, because we are debugging.

1. Configure:
```
  make menuconfig ARCH=riscv_64
```
or
```
  make ARCH=riscv_64 defconfig
```
We temporarily use NUMA settings in menuconfig to set the SMP config. (We can't enable NUMA in risc-v.) If you want to enable SMP, make sure the number in NUMA settings is N (default is 1), which means the number of processors.

2. Create file system
```
  make sfsimg
  make sfsimg2
```
Here we use sfsimg2 for SFAT file system, which is an example to prove the correctness of our LKM in risc-v.

3. (Optional) create swap file
If you define "Support for paging of anonymous memory(swap)" in menuconfig, then run:
```
  make swapimg
```

4. Create kernel
```
  make
```

5. Run ucore
```
  ./uCore_run -c -d obj
```

6. (Optional) Test ucore
```
  ./uCore_test -d obj
```
